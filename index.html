        <h2>Where do people get fruits and veggies from? Simple, all of these things you get on your daily bases are from farmers. Farming plays a very important role in our lives because it helps us survive by having more food sources. Just imagine without farming, we wouldn't have any veggies or fruits etc because there are many people in the world which need food to survive. Without farming it would lower the food sources by a lot. This also makes many of the food sources to go extinct because without replacing the things we have eaten, the amount of food would eventually run out.   </h2>

        <h1>Hardware</h1>
        
        <ul>
          <p>
          <li>GIS-Based Architecture, this is a machine that helps farmers farm accurately and efficiently. It is able to show the temperature and the crops health. <img></li>
          <li>Online Data, this is basically a type of data which allows the farmer to be able to send a satellite to capture the overview of the farming place.</li>
          <li>Drones are able to define crop biomass, plant height, and water saturation on areas with high precision. According to the website it says that the drones give much more accurate Cdata than the satellite but the satellite is better than the drone when it comes to monitoring large areas. Drones are very effective in fighting off unwanted insects using insecticide and this also helps us physically because we won’t be inhaling the chemicals which could possibly lead to chemical poisoning.</li>

        <h1>Software</h1>
        <ul>
          <p>
            <li>Farm Works is a software that is designed for management records. It can capture multiple animal identifications while tracking treatments, weanings, pedigrees, breeding, and animal movement.</li>
            <li>AgroSense is very accurate and reliable. It collects high-resolution data such as soil moisture, lead wetness, irrigation, and it is also good at finance management. It brings all the income information together for the tracking report.</li>
            <li>Sentera is good at delivering critical, real-time crop health measurements to the advisors and growers. It also gives the users high-performance tools to continuously improve their operations on and off the field.</li>

        <h1>Invention Idea</h1>
        <p>A drone that can plant, scan, water, basically do anything to the plants. This drone can shoot out seeds which can be shooted deep into the soil but it wouldn’t damage the seed itself. It can also scan large amounts of plants within seconds and gather datas for each specific plant with their needs. Once the scanning is done the drone would quickly fill out the requirements for every plant.</p>
